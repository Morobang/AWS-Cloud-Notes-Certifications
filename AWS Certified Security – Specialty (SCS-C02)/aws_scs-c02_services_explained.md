## Networking and Content Delivery Services

### Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- **Purpose:** Provides isolated virtual networks within AWS.

- **Network ACLs:** Stateless subnet-level packet filtering.
  - *Example:* Blocks inbound traffic from suspicious IP addresses.
- **Security Groups:** Stateful firewalls applied to instances.
  - *Example:* Allows inbound SSH access only from trusted IP ranges.
- **VPC Endpoints:** Private connections to AWS services without internet exposure.
  - *Example:* EC2 instances access S3 privately through a VPC endpoint.

### AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)
- **Purpose:** Centralizes identity and access management.
- **Security Role:** Simplifies user access management with single sign-on.
- **Example:** Allows developers to access multiple AWS accounts with one login.

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- **Purpose:** Manages user identities, roles, and permissions.
- **Security Role:** Implements least privilege access control.
- **Example:** Grants a Lambda function only the permissions it needs to access DynamoDB.

### Amazon Inspector
- **Purpose:** Automates security assessments of EC2 and container images.
- **Security Role:** Detects vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.
- **Example:** Identifies outdated software versions on EC2 instances.

### AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
- **Purpose:** Manages encryption keys and cryptographic operations.
- **Security Role:** Centralizes key management with audit and access controls.
- **Example:** Encrypts EBS volumes and S3 objects using customer-managed keys.

### Amazon Macie
- **Purpose:** Uses ML to detect sensitive data in S3.
- **Security Role:** Prevents data leaks by alerting on exposed PII.
- **Example:** Flags S3 buckets containing unencrypted credit card numbers.

### AWS Network Firewall
- **Purpose:** Stateful network firewall for VPCs.
- **Security Role:** Provides advanced traffic filtering.
- **Example:** Blocks outbound traffic to malicious IP addresses.

### AWS Security Hub
- **Purpose:** Aggregates security alerts and compliance checks.
- **Security Role:** Provides a centralized dashboard for security posture.
- **Example:** Consolidates findings from GuardDuty, Inspector, and Macie.

### AWS Shield
- **Purpose:** DDoS protection for AWS resources.
- **Security Role:** Mitigates volumetric and protocol attacks.
- **Example:** Automatically blocks DDoS attacks targeting your web application.

### AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- **Purpose:** Protects web applications by filtering HTTP/S traffic.
- **Security Role:** Blocks attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
- **Example:** Blocks traffic containing SQL injection attempts before reaching your app.
