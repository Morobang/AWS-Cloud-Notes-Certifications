---

## ✅ Task 1.1: **Make a Plan for When Bad Things Happen**

### What is this about?

Imagine your house has an alarm system. If someone tries to break in, the alarm goes off. You don’t just scream and run — you have a plan! Maybe lock the doors, call someone for help, and turn on the lights.

AWS needs the same kind of plan. If something strange happens in the cloud, we need to **find it**, **stop it**, and **fix it**.

---

### What are the important things to know?

* **AWS Best Practices**: Like a rulebook on how to stay safe.
* **Cloud Incidents**: Bad things like someone stealing your password, a virus, or someone breaking into your AWS resources.
* **Who does what?**

  * Security team: Like your home security — they investigate.
  * DevOps team: Like tech fixers — they shut down the problem.
  * Managers: They decide what actions to take.

---

### What do you need to do?

* 🔑 **Credential Rotation**: If someone gets your secret key, you change it fast. AWS has tools like **IAM** and **Secrets Manager** to help.
* 🚪 **Isolate the Danger**: Like closing the door to a burning room. You can use special “walls” in AWS (security groups, VPCs) to stop the spread.
* 📕 **Playbooks and Runbooks**: Like instruction books that tell you exactly what to do when there's a problem.
* 🤖 **Automation**: Set up robots (like Lambda functions) to act instantly when something bad happens.

## ✅ Task 1.2: **Catch the Bad Guys Before They Do Harm**

### What is this about?

Think of security cameras around your house — they watch all the time. If they see something weird, they tell you.

AWS uses **tools that watch everything** and tell you when something’s wrong.

---

### The security “cameras”:

* **GuardDuty**: Spots bad behavior, like if someone sneaks in.
* **Macie**: Looks for sensitive stuff like secret papers (PII) lying around.
* **Config**: Makes sure your house is set up safely (like windows locked).
* **Inspector**: Checks for broken things in your house (security holes).
* **IAM Access Analyzer**: Warns if your doors are accidentally left open.

---

### What can you do with these tools?

* 👀 **Look at Warnings**: See what’s wrong and how serious it is.
* 🔗 **Connect the Dots**: Combine clues to find out what happened.
* 🔍 **Check the Logs**: Logs are like footprints in the snow. You can track where the intruder came from.
* 📊 **Dashboards**: Make big colorful charts to show what’s going on in your AWS house.

---

## ✅ Task 1.3: **Fix the Problem After It Happens**

### What is this about?

Let’s say someone spilled juice on your laptop (uh-oh). You don’t panic — you unplug it, dry it, and maybe take it to a repair shop.

Same thing with AWS — we want to **stop the damage**, **look into the problem**, and **recover safely**.

---

### How do we do that?

* 🛑 **Stop the Problem**: Disconnect the broken machine (EC2), change passwords, lock things down.
* 🔎 **Investigate**: Use tools like **Detective** and **CloudTrail** to see how the bad guy got in.
* 🧪 **Capture Clues**: Like taking photos of the crime scene (snapshots, memory dumps).
* 🔐 **Save Evidence**: Store important logs safely so no one can change them.
* 🔁 **Recover**: Bring back your stuff from backup and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
